* Figwheel autobuilds no longer works on clojure 1.10.0-alpha9

Updating from 1.10.0-alpha8 to 1.10.0-alpha9 breaks figwheels
autorebuild. To test clone this repository and run with =clj
-A:build-dev= change the source file and see how a rebuild is
performed. Stop the repl and instead use the comman =clj
-A:build-dev:beta1= changing the source files no longer triggers a rebuild.
The issue is fixed in =clj -A:build-dev:beta2=
